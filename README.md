## Q3

You can run the `maze_simulate.m`  in Matlab to do Monte Carlo simulation. You can change the scenarios indicated in the word document by commenting and uncommenting the lines below.

```matlab
    tot = tot + maze_problem_1();
	% tot = tot + maze_problem_2();
```

You can run the `month_end_testing.m` to test the result. Note that the `dataset.xlsx` whould be in the same directory with the code.
